## Testing

This project is unit tested in CI with [`arduino_ci`](https://github.com/Arduino-CI/arduino_ci).  To run these tests locally, you will need a functioning ruby environment -- and to install the program with  `gem install arduino_ci` (or `gem update arduino_ci`).  Then you will be able to run the command `arduino-ci.rb` from the root directory of this project.
